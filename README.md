# I3 And Vim Configurations
These are my I3 and Vim config files. Feel free to try them out!

Install Process For Vim Config (Linux):

1. Download Vim using your package manager
2. Copy or download my .vimrc file and move it to ~/.vimrc

Install Process For I3 WM:

1. Install I3 WM on top of any distro
2. Install i3status and i3lock
3. Install picom from package manager (Compositor to make windows semi-transparent)
4. Install nitrogen from package manager and run it setting your preferred background image
5. Download my picom.conf file and place it in your ~/.config folder
6. Download my i3 config folder and place it in your ~/.config folder
8. Download my i3-status folder and place it in your ~/.config folder
9. Download my scripts folder and place it in your ~/.config folder
10. Ensure you have installed the Scrot package for screenshots (Mod + Shift + S is bound to a screenshot script with that dependency)
11. Reload I3-WM and you should be good to go!

Install for Alacritty:

1. Install alacritty from your pacakage manager
2. Download my alacritty config folder and place it in your ~/.config folder



NOTE:

I use colemak so my configuration may be a little bit weird for I3, but my vim keybinds are stock with slight usability tweaks. I use my vim config daily for python programming.

Features:

1. Mod+l locks the screen by taking a screenshot and blurring it!
2. Mod+Shift+S takes a screenshot and saves it to the clipboard and to the Downloads folder.
4. Picom configured to make windows semi transparent and add fluid animations
5. Vim configured to work well with space indentation using python and no distractions from status bar or code completion.
6. Alacritty setup to match theme of i3
